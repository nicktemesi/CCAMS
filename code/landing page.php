                                Everyone has a talent or an ability and if not nartured it can die. Many campus students give up on this abilities and talents. The problem is that they are not aware that the activities they can engage in
                                are still available in campus. Most campuses engage in the traditional sense of posting on the notice boards which are rarely checked by students.
                                Through CCAMS one can join a group that offers an activity of their choice be it dance, coding, music, religion etc and this groups can post content on the platform for

                                ability to manage content and settings within the group. The app includes a calendar feature, where admins can add events with details like the title, date, and description. Group members can view upcoming

                        I created this system because I'm a victim of the normal comrades life. 
                        Many a times when our classes would "bounce" as comrades we would be free and have nothing important
                        to do. 90% of the time we ended up wasting that time either on drugs, random games that didn't make sense.
                        There were activities that went on in school at that exact times when the class "bounced" but we weren't aware of them.
                        And  its not because the activities are not advertised, they were but it didn't reach a lot of comrades. Most of the time
                        they used notice boards which 90% of students don't read.
                        Another scenario is during my web development journey, i really struggled understanding the long lines of code
                        on my own. I knew there were better developers than me who could help but I didn't know a way of getting to them. This 
                        app will solve just that; activity groups will be able to get their adverts to a much larger audience and students can join those groups.
                        This way they'll make much better user of their time and create better value of themselves. Its only when classes 'bounce' but anytime and day the 
                        group will activities you'll be engaged. <b>Go ahead</b> and <b><a href="account creation page.php" style="color: black;">create an accout with us</a></b> to get more value off of yourself.
